# LogReader v1.0 Release Notes

**Release Date**: January 2025
**Version**: 1.0
**Type**: Major Release - Python GUI Implementation

---

## Overview

LogReader v1.0 marks the transition from a C++ terminal-based application to a modern Python GUI application built with PyQt6. This release includes complete feature parity with the original C++ version plus significant enhancements.

---

## What's New in v1.0

### Major Features

#### 1. **Native GUI Interface**
- Modern PyQt6-based graphical user interface
- Native file dialogs for intuitive file selection
- Professional status bar with real-time information
- Resizable window with flexible layout

#### 2. **Line Number Navigation**
- Original file line numbers displayed in dedicated column
- Jump to Line feature for instant navigation
- Auto-clear filters when jumping to ensure visibility
- Essential for debugging workflows and team collaboration

#### 3. **Enhanced File Management**
- Native file picker with "Open..." dialog (Ctrl+O)
- Remembers last directory between sessions
- Reload functionality (Ctrl+R) for actively changing files
- Config file stores both directory and file path

#### 4. **Improved Status Reporting**
- Professional status bar at bottom of window
- Four sections: Status | File | Entries | Line Info
- Real-time parsing progress with percentage
- Entry count shows total and filtered visibility

#### 5. **Better User Experience**
- Cleaner interface (removed terminal UI constraints)
- Standard GUI patterns and behaviors
- Multi-row selection with Ctrl+C copy
- Keyboard shortcuts follow platform conventions

### Technical Improvements

#### Performance
- **Async Parsing**: Background thread prevents UI blocking
- **Batched Processing**: 5,000 lines per batch for smooth progress
- **Filtered Indices**: Memory efficient (no entry copying)
- **Performance**: ~4,400 entries/sec parsing, <1ms filtering

#### Architecture
- **Model/View Pattern**: Qt's efficient table display
- **Thread Safety**: Mutex-protected data access
- **Signal/Slot Communication**: Thread-safe UI updates
- **Virtualized Rendering**: Only visible rows rendered

## Breaking Changes

### Migration from C++ Version

**File Format**: No changes - uses same ASCII field separator format (char 31)

**Configuration**:
- Old single-line config (file path only) → New two-line format (directory + file path)
- Automatic migration on first run

**No Action Required**: Users can simply start using the Python version with existing log files.

## Installation

### System Requirements
- Python 3.10 or higher
- PyQt6 6.6.0 or higher
- 512MB RAM minimum (2GB+ for large files)
