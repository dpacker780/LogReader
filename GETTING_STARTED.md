# Getting Started with LogReader v1.0

**Quick start guide to get LogReader running in 5 minutes.**

---

## Prerequisites Check

Before you begin, verify you have:

```bash
# Check Python version (need 3.10+)
python --version
```

If Python is not installed or version is < 3.10:
- **Windows**: Download from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (check "Add to PATH")
- **macOS**: `brew install python@3.10`
- **Linux**: `sudo apt install python3.10 python3.10-venv`

---

## Installation (3 Steps)

### 1. Create Virtual Environment

```bash
cd /path/to/LogReader
python -m venv venv
```

### 2. Activate Virtual Environment

**Windows:**
```cmd
venv\Scripts\activate
```

**macOS/Linux:**
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

You should see `(venv)` in your prompt.

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This installs PyQt6 (~50MB download).

---

## Running LogReader

```bash
python python/main.py
```

The LogReader window should open immediately.

## Troubleshooting

### "python: command not found"

- Reinstall with "Add to PATH" option

### "No module named 'PyQt6'"
- Virtual environment not activated or dependencies not installed
- Run: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

### Application won't start
- Check Python version: `python --version` (must be 3.10+)
- Check if venv activated: look for `(venv)` in prompt
- Try: `pip list | grep PyQt6` to verify installation

### File won't open
- Verify file format uses ASCII field separator (char 31)
- See README.md for log format specification
